My approach----->
as data has very high dimension and number of samples is low
---> I regularized the data
---> as first filtering feacher approach I used Chai2 test and took 1500 Gene expression that scored high in this test
---> then applied PCA ( Principal componet analysis ), and reduced that data dimension to very low.( to 32-180 feachers)
---> Then feed them into Neural network with 1 hidden network.
---> applied L2 regularization to stop overfitting and have good performance out of samples

Datasets:


Braintumer dataset( Most hard one)

We used the dataset  from the original research done by Pomeroy et al., consisting of 40 samples from 5 diagnostic classes (medulloblastomas, malignant gliomas, atypicalteratoid/rhabdoid tumors, primitive neuroectodermal tumors and normal cerebella).
 medulloblastoma (medulloblastoma): 10 examples 
- malignant glioma (glioma): 10 examples 
- Rhabdoid tumor (RhabdoidTu): 10 examples 
- normal cerebellum (Normal): 4 examples 
- primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET): 6 examples 
Number of genes: 7129
Number of samples: 40

Lung Cancer

Dataset consistes fo  four different lung tumors (adenocarcinomas, small-cell lung carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas and carcinoids) and normal lung tissue on the basis of DNA expression signatures.

-adenocarcinoma (AD): 139 examples 
- normal lung (NL): 17 examples 
- small cell lung cancer (SMCL): 6 examples 
- squamous cell carcinoma (SQ): 21 examples 
- pulmonary carcinoid (COID): 20 examples 

Number of genes: 12600
Number of samples: 203

Prostate Cancer:
Dataset consistes of Gene expression of tissues taken from normal prostate and samples of prostate tumors.

 normal tissue (normal): 50 examples 
 prostate tumor (tumor): 52 examples 

Number of genes: 12533
Number of samples: 102


Ovary Cancer:


Dataset consistes of Gene expression of tissues taken from around normal ovary and samples of ovary cancer tissue.

normal tissue (normal): 125 examples 
 prostate tumor (tumor): 128 examples 
 
Number of genes: 15154
Number of samples: 253


Result:

I ran 3 different model,
that one is my main approach. 
And other 2 without PCA( l1 regularization and l2 regularization)

dataset 	ovary 		lung		braintumer	prostate
PCA 		100%		95.62%		80%		94.16%	
l1		98%		94.34		82.5%		93.33%
l2		99.59%		93.4		90%		92.5%

( low performance in braintumer, cause it have so much data to do principal componet analysis. Because with only 40 sample and 5 classes , not good to reduce much data such case  :(  )

This may show no big difference in performance, but Model complexity of PCA is several time lower that l1 nad 2.
for example 

total trainable parameter of ovaryset is : 9,006,002( with out PCA, took around 1 min training)

in case of PCA # of parameter:  209,078( took less than 5 sec in traning)

They proposed only pca as feacher extractor . And Feed that in to four diiffernt type of classifier.(Sparse Autoencoder,Stacked Autoencoder,Stacked Autoencoderwith Fine Tunning ,  Softmax / SVM (with Gaussian kernel))
they and me have 2 simmiler dataset . 
( prostate and overy) performance is same for(  softmax SVM). For other models my model performs better.




[paper ---> Discriminative Gene Selection Employing Linear
Regression Model
Abid Hasan α, Shaikh Jeeshan Kabeer σ, Md. Abdul Mottalib ρ & Kamrul Hasan]
they applied no PCA. But they used different scoring function to filter feachers( like Chai2,ReliefF,GainRatio Value) and aslo proposed a scoring model.

performace:[ here best means best one among different scoring mechanism ]
for prostate : svm(best) 91, 	adboost(best)75, 	randomforest(best)83
lungs :		svm(best)97.98 	adboost(best) 97.98 	randomforest(best) 97.98
Just to compare( their lungs and my lung dataset is same, but origianl dataset have 5 classes( described above). they mergeded 4 different lung cance as one , just cancer. where as with 5 classes by performace is 95.62(near them) )
