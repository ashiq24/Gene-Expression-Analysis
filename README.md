# Gene-Expression-Analysis
It is simple classifire ; that predicts cancer from gene expression .

The code is done using Keras.
it is a simple Multy layed Perceptron(MLP) with feacher selection.
For feacher selection PCA and Chi square test is done.

Using this two feacher selection techniques along with MLP, It give the highest so far attaing accuaracy .
