# Gene-Expression-Analysis
It is simple classifire ; that predicts cancer from gene expression .

The code is done using Keras.
it is a simple Multy layed Perceptron(MLP) with feacher selection.
For feacher selection PCA and Chi square test is done at a time and this creats the magic.

Using this two feacher selection techniques along with MLP, It give the highest so far attaing accuaracy .

All the related literature and dataset is given .
